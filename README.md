# FOR-POWER
The Forest for Hydropower (FOR-POWER) consists of a simple modeling framework that integrates global datasets and proven effects of deforestation on hydropower generation, via erosion and sediment accumulation. 

The framework is coded in MATLAB and Python for the users convenience. Also included here is a spreadsheet with the input dataset for four dams in Cambodia where the framework was applied. Both scripts provided are samples applied to one of the dams, Battambang 2.
